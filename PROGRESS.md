# Progress Report - AI Agent Integration

## CRITICAL REMINDER: NEVER MARK FEATURES AS COMPLETE WITHOUT HUMAN TESTING

Any feature marked as "✅ Completed" means it has been TESTED AND VERIFIED by a human.
Features that compile but haven't been tested must be marked as "IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT TESTED".

## Session: 2026-02-20 - CLI List Parity with TUI

### Summary

Fixed CLI `list` command to hide tasks from inactive projects (paused, cancelled, or not-yet-begun), matching the TUI's existing behavior. Also added `--begin` flag to `update` command.

### Features Implemented ✅

**1. Sort Projects by Begin Date (v0.30.0)**
- Added `begin` (and `start` alias) to `sortProjects` in project_commands.go
- Earliest start date first, empty dates sorted last

**2. CLI List Hides Inactive Project Tasks (v0.29.0)**
- `atask list` now builds a hidden project set during first pass (same logic as TUI model.go)
- Tasks belonging to paused, cancelled, or not-yet-begun projects are excluded
- `--all` flag bypasses this filtering
- Fixes aweb showing tasks from paused projects in the web UI

**2. `--begin` Flag for Update (v0.28.0)**
- Added `--begin` flag to `atask update` command
- Parses natural language dates via `denote.ParseNaturalDate`
- Sets `TaskMetadata.StartDate`

### Files Modified
- `internal/cli/task_commands.go` - Added hidden project filtering to list, added --begin to update

### Releases
- **v0.28.0** - `--begin` flag for update
- **v0.29.0** - CLI list hides inactive project tasks
- **v0.30.0** - Sort projects by begin date

## Session: 2026-02-18 (Continued) - UX Improvements & Project ID Migration

### Summary

Multiple improvements: switched project_id from Denote timestamp to index_id (with migration), added Done hotkey, emacs keybindings in edit fields, due today filter, fixed project line spacing, and honored default_area config at startup.

### Features Implemented ✅

**1. project_id Migration (v0.22.0)**
- Switched all project_id references from Denote timestamp to sequential index_id
- Added `atask migrate project-id-to-index` command with `--dry-run` support
- Modified 10 files across CLI, TUI, and denote packages

**2. Done Hotkey (v0.23.0)**
- `D` marks task as done from list view and task detail view
- Handles recurrence (creates next instance if recurring)

**3. Emacs/Readline Keybindings (v0.23.0)**
- ctrl+a/e (home/end), ctrl+b/f (back/forward), ctrl+h/d (delete char)
- ctrl+k (kill to end), ctrl+u (kill to beginning), ctrl+w (delete word backward)
- Applied to all 5 edit field handlers across keys.go, task_view_keys.go, project_view_keys.go

**4. Due Today Filter (v0.24.0)**
- Toggle with `t` in filter menu
- Shows only tasks/projects due today
- Shows in header bar and filter menu, clears with `c`

**5. Bug Fixes (v0.23.0)**
- Fixed project line column alignment (pad before color, not after)
- Fixed default_area config not being applied at TUI startup

### Releases
- **v0.22.0** - project_id migration to index_id
- **v0.23.0** - Done hotkey, emacs keybindings, project line fix, default_area fix
- **v0.24.0** - Due today filter

## Session: 2026-02-18 - Default State Filter & Loose Tasks Filter

### Summary

Added default state filter to hide completed tasks at TUI launch, and a "loose tasks" filter to show only tasks with no project association.

### Features Implemented ✅

**1. Default State Filter**
- New `default_state_filter` config option under `[tasks]` (default: `"incomplete"`)
- "incomplete" pseudo-state hides done tasks and completed/cancelled projects
- Applied at model initialization so it takes effect before first render
- State filters now apply to projects too (previously task-only)
- Available in state filter menu as `(i) Incomplete`

**2. Loose Tasks Filter**
- Toggle with `l` in filter menu
- Shows only tasks with no `project_id` (hides projects too)
- Useful for finding orphaned tasks

**3. Project State Filtering**
- "incomplete" → hides completed and cancelled projects
- "active" → shows only active projects
- Specific task statuses → hides all projects (no equivalent)

### Files Modified
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added `DefaultStateFilter` field, default, validation
- `internal/tui/model.go` - Added `looseFilter`, "incomplete" filter logic, default state in NewModel
- `internal/tui/tui.go` - Removed post-init filter (moved to NewModel)
- `internal/tui/keys.go` - Added `i` and `l` key handlers, use config default instead of hardcoded "active"
- `internal/tui/views.go` - Added "Incomplete" and "Loose" to menus and status bar
- `README.md` - Updated config example and hotkey docs
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v0.21.0 entry
- `SKILL.md` - Added config docs for `default_state_filter`

### Release
- **v0.21.0** - Default state filter and loose tasks filter

## Session: 2026-02-15 (Evening) - Tag for Today Feature & TUI Alignment Fixes

### Summary

Implemented "tag for today" feature for morning time-blocking workflow and fixed critical TUI alignment issues. Released as v0.18.0.

### Major Features Implemented ✅

**1. Tag for Today Feature**
- Added `TodayDate` field to TaskMetadata (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Tasks tagged for today appear at top with ★ indicator
- Visual separator line between today tasks and regular tasks
- Hotkey 'y' to toggle today tag on selected task
- Hotkey 'Y' (shift) to clear all today tags with confirmation dialog
- Auto-clears overnight (tasks show as not-tagged-for-today when date doesn't match)
- Query language support: `today:tagged`, `today_date:2026-02-15`
- Stable sort properly handles tasks vs projects
- Tested: All functionality working perfectly

**2. TUI Alignment Fixes**
- Fixed critical rendering bug where columns misaligned
- Root cause: Nested ANSI escape sequences from wrapping colored fields in additional `.Render()` calls
- Solution: Pad text BEFORE applying color, return lines directly without additional wrapping
- Projects and tasks now use identical line format for perfect alignment
- Applied fix to both renderTaskLine() and renderProjectLine()
- Tested: Perfect alignment with all field combinations

**3. SKILL.md Documentation**
- Added comprehensive "★ Daily Planning with 'Tag for Today'" section
- Proactive agent behavior patterns for morning planning
- CLI and TUI usage examples
- Agent workflow examples (morning planning, follow-up, cleanup)
- Query language reference
- Installed globally in ~/.claude/skills/atask/

### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/denote/types.go` - Added TodayDate field and IsTaggedForToday() method
- `internal/query/ast.go` - Added today/today_date field evaluation
- `internal/tui/model.go` - Added toggleTodayTag(), clearAllTodayTags(), ModeConfirmClearToday
- `internal/tui/model.go` - Fixed sortFiles() to properly handle tasks vs projects
- `internal/tui/views.go` - Added ★ indicator, separator line, fixed alignment by padding before coloring
- `internal/tui/keys.go` - Added 'y' and 'Y' handlers, handleConfirmClearTodayKeys()
- `~/.claude/skills/atask/SKILL.md` - Added comprehensive today feature documentation

**Alignment Fix Details:**
- Changed from: `lipgloss.Style.Width().Render()` + `fmt.Sprintf("%*s")` mixing
- Changed to: `fmt.Sprintf("%-*s")` for padding THEN `lipgloss.Style.Render()` for color
- Avoided nested .Render() calls that wrap already-colored text
- Used string concatenation instead of fmt.Sprintf for final line assembly

### Release

- **v0.18.0** - Tag for Today feature + TUI alignment fixes

### Testing Status

All features tested and verified:
- ✅ Today indicator (★) displays correctly
- ✅ Tasks sort to top when tagged for today
- ✅ Separator line appears at correct position
- ✅ 'y' hotkey toggles today tag
- ✅ 'Y' hotkey shows confirmation and clears all
- ✅ Query language `today:tagged` works
