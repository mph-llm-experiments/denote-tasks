# Progress Report - AI Agent Integration

## CRITICAL REMINDER: NEVER MARK FEATURES AS COMPLETE WITHOUT HUMAN TESTING

Any feature marked as "✅ Completed" means it has been TESTED AND VERIFIED by a human.
Features that compile but haven't been tested must be marked as "IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT TESTED".

## Session: 2026-02-15 - AI Agent Integration Features

### Summary

Implemented comprehensive AI agent integration capabilities, making denote-tasks a powerful tool for programmatic task management. Released as v0.17.0 with three subsequent patch releases.

### Major Features Implemented ✅

**1. JSON Output for All Commands** (Issue #12)
- Added `--json` flag to all list/query commands
- Structured output for programmatic parsing
- Includes task/project metadata, project names, task counts
- Tested with jq for field extraction

**2. Query Command with Boolean Logic** (Issue #13)
- Implemented recursive descent parser for query language
- Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT with parentheses for precedence
- Comparison operators: `:`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`
- 15+ searchable fields (status, priority, area, tags, content, etc.)
- Special date values: `due:overdue`, `due:soon`, `due:today`, `due:week`
- Special project values: `project_id:empty`, `project_id:set`
- Tested with complex queries like `(priority:p1 OR priority:p2) AND NOT status:done`

**3. Batch-Update Command** (Issue #14)
- Conditional filtering with `--where` clause using query language
- Update multiple tasks at once (priority, status, area, due date, project)
- `--dry-run` flag for previewing changes before applying
- Tested with tag-based and content-based filters

**4. Full-Text Search** (Issue #15)
- Search in task/project file content with `--search` flag
- Query language support with `content:`, `body:`, `text:` fields
- Case-insensitive substring matching
- Combines with other filters and JSON output
- Tested with keyword searches and complex queries

### TUI Improvements ✅

**5. Project Status Menu Fix**
- Fixed TUI to show correct status options for projects vs tasks
- Projects: active/completed/paused/cancelled
- Tasks: open/done/paused/delegated/dropped
- Removed restriction preventing state changes on projects
- Tested: Can now change project status from TUI

**6. Responsive Footer Wrapping**
- Main view footer wraps based on terminal width
- Task detail view footer wraps responsively
- Project detail view footer wraps responsively
- "Due today" cutline adjusts to terminal width
- Tested: All footers and cutlines resize properly

### Documentation ✅

**7. README Updates**
- Added "AI Agent Integration" section with examples
- Query language reference with all operators and fields
- Usage examples for JSON output, queries, batch-update, search
- Updated feature list

**8. AI Agent Skill File**
- Created comprehensive SKILL.md (28KB)
- Quick decision tree for agents
- Agent workflow guide with scenarios
- Best practices with ✅/❌ indicators
- Copy-paste ready command templates
- Emphasized machine-friendly features (JSON, query, batch)
- Added to repository root for easy installation

### Releases

- **v0.17.0** - Major feature release (JSON, query, batch-update, search)
- **v0.17.1** - Documentation (SKILL.md added to repo)
- **v0.17.2** - TUI fixes (footer wrapping in detail views)
- **v0.17.3** - TUI fixes (responsive cutline)

### Implementation Details

**Query Language Architecture:**
- `internal/query/token.go` - Tokenizer for lexical analysis
- `internal/query/ast.go` - AST nodes and evaluation logic
- `internal/query/parser.go` - Recursive descent parser

**Key Files Modified:**
- `internal/cli/task_commands.go` - Added query, batch-update, JSON output, --search flag
- `internal/cli/project_commands.go` - Added JSON output, --search flag
- `internal/denote/types.go` - Added JSON tags to all structs
- `internal/tui/keys.go` - Fixed project status handling
- `internal/tui/model.go` - Added updateCurrentProjectStatus()
- `internal/tui/views.go` - Fixed state menu, footer wrapping, responsive cutline
- `internal/tui/task_view.go` - Footer wrapping
- `internal/tui/project_view.go` - Footer wrapping
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation updates
- `SKILL.md` - AI agent integration guide

### Bug Fixes Applied

1. **Area flag not working** - Fixed global vs local flag parsing
2. **Query parsing flags** - Fixed to use only first argument
3. **Tag field singular/plural** - Added both "tag" and "tags" as aliases
4. **TUI tags not showing** - Fixed to use TaskMetadata.Tags instead of file.Tags
5. **Project status menu** - Fixed to show project statuses not task statuses
6. **Function name error** - Fixed task.UpdateProjectFile → denote.UpdateProjectFile

### Testing Status

All features have been tested and verified working:
- ✅ JSON output parses correctly with jq
- ✅ Query language handles complex boolean expressions
- ✅ Batch-update with --dry-run and actual updates
- ✅ Full-text search finds content in task files
- ✅ Project status menu shows correct options
- ✅ All footers wrap responsively
- ✅ Cutline adjusts to terminal width

### GitHub Issues Closed

- Issue #12: JSON output ✅
- Issue #13: Query command ✅
- Issue #14: Batch-update ✅
- Issue #15: Full-text search ✅

### Remaining Open Issues (Tier 2 & 3)

**Tier 2 (Medium Effort):**
- Issue #16: Export formats (CSV, iCalendar, HTML)
- Issue #17: Export core scanner/filter as reusable Go package
- Issue #18: Task dependencies (blocking/blocked-by)
- Issue #19: Audit trail with change history

**Tier 3 (Future/Speculative):**
- Issue #20: Webhooks/event system
- Issue #21: Task templates and recurring tasks
- Issue #22: Custom status/priority workflow configuration
- Issue #23: Time tracking with estimate vs actual analysis

### Continuity System Established

Created comprehensive tracking system:
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md - Release history for users
- ✅ PROGRESS.md - Current session work (this file)
- ✅ Auto Memory - Patterns and decisions
- ✅ GitHub Issues - Feature tracking
- ✅ Git Tags - Version history with release notes
