## [Unreleased]

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **"D" hotkey for Done** - Quick mark-as-done from list view and task detail view, with recurrence support
- **Due today filter** - Toggle with `t` in filter menu to show only tasks due today
- **Emacs/readline keybindings** in all edit fields - ctrl+a/e (home/end), ctrl+b/f (back/forward), ctrl+h/d (delete), ctrl+k (kill to end), ctrl+u (kill to beginning), ctrl+w (delete word backward)

### Fixed
- **Project line column alignment** - Fixed spacing issue where ANSI color codes caused misaligned columns in project rows
- **default_area config not honored** - TUI now applies `default_area` setting at startup

## [0.22.0] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **project_id uses index_id** - Task `project_id` now stores sequential index_id instead of Denote timestamp, fixing ambiguity when projects share timestamps
- Added `atask migrate project-id-to-index` command for one-time data migration

## [0.21.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Default state filter** - TUI now hides completed tasks at launch via `default_state_filter = "incomplete"` config option
  - New "incomplete" pseudo-state: shows everything except done tasks and completed projects
  - Configurable: set to `"incomplete"`, `"active"`, any specific status, or `""` for no filter
  - State filters now apply to projects too (incomplete hides completed/cancelled, active shows only active, specific statuses hide projects)
- **Loose tasks filter** - Toggle with `l` in filter menu to show only tasks with no project association
  - Useful for finding orphaned tasks that need to be organized into projects

## [0.19.0] - 2026-02-16

### Changed
- **Project renamed from "denote-tasks" to "atask"**
  - Binary name: `denote-tasks` → `atask`
  - Go module: `github.com/pdxmph/denote-tasks` → `github.com/mph-llm-experiments/atask`
  - Config directory: `~/.config/denote-tasks/` → `~/.config/atask/`
  - Skill name: `denote-tasks` → `atask`
  - Completion files: `denote-tasks.bash`, `_denote-tasks` → `atask.bash`, `_atask`
  - All documentation and help text updated
  - **Breaking change**: Existing installations will need to:
    - Reinstall or rebuild the binary
    - Rename config directory: `mv ~/.config/denote-tasks ~/.config/atask`
    - Reinstall shell completions
    - Update SKILL.md installation path in `~/.claude/skills/`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Tag for Today feature** for morning time-blocking workflow
  - Tasks tagged for today appear at top of list with ★ indicator
  - Visual separator line between today tasks and regular tasks
  - Hotkey 'y' to toggle today tag on selected task
  - Hotkey 'Y' (shift) to clear all today tags with confirmation dialog
  - Auto-clears overnight when date changes (no manual cleanup needed)
  - Query language support: `today:tagged`, `today_date:YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Added `TodayDate` field to TaskMetadata
- SKILL.md documentation section for "Daily Planning with Tag for Today"
  - Proactive agent behavior patterns
  - CLI and TUI usage examples
  - Agent workflow examples for morning planning

### Fixed
- **TUI alignment issues** - tasks and projects now align perfectly
  - Fixed nested ANSI escape sequences causing column misalignment
  - Pad text BEFORE applying color instead of after
  - Avoid wrapping entire lines in additional .Render() calls
  - Projects and tasks use identical line format
- Stable sort now properly handles tasks vs projects (all tasks before all projects)

## [0.17.3] - 2026-02-15
